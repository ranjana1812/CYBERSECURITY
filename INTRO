CYBERSECURITY SECURING DATAS AND FILES
SECURING,SAFEGUARDING FACTORS
1)PHYSICAL CONTROL
2)ADMINSTRATIVE CONTROL 
3)LOGICAL CONTROL
PORTSCANNING 
PROTOCOLS : SET OF RULES 
TCP/UDP CONNECTS BETWEEN HAEDWARE & SOFTWARE
65535 TCP PORTS + ADDITIONALLY UDP 65535 PORTS = 1,30,070 PORTS
443 PORT WORKS ON HTTPS (SAFE)
HTTP WORKS ON PORT 80 (UNSAFE) SPECIALLY TCP
D/B HTTP VS HTTPS

CIA STANDS FOR
CONFIDENTIALITY 2)INTEGRITY 3)AVAILABILITY
AUTHENTICATION VERIFY SOMEONE'S IDENTITY
3 FACTORS:
1)SOMETHING U KNOWN (KNOWLEDGE FACTOR) 
EG:2 FACTOR AUTHENTICATION,EMAIL,SECRET QUESTION,PASSWORD
USERNAME ,PASSWORD SINGLE FACTOR AUTHENTICATION
USERNAME,PASSWORD,OTP 2 FACTOR AUTHENTICATION
2)SOMETHING U HAVE(AADHAR,PAN,VOTER)
3)SOMETIG U ARE(BIOMETRICS,HEIGHT,WEIGHT)
AUTHORIZATION/ACESS CONTROL  PERMISSION TO ACESS
UAC USER ACESS CONTROL (POPUP)
INTEGRITY :ORGINALITY AND GENUINENESS
eg:HTTPS SECURITY MECHANISM
SSL SECURED SOFTWARE LAYER

EVENT - ANY OBSERVABLE OCCURRENCE IN A NETWORK OR SYSTEM.NIST SP 800-61 REV 2.
BUG - ACTUAL VALUE DEVIATED 
INCIDENT- EVENT THAT ACTUALLY OR POTENTIALLY JEOPARDIZES (AFFECTS CIA)

Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is an IP address allocation method that improves data routing efficiency on the internet.
256 IP ADDRESSS IS POSSSIBLE
198.168.1.255->256 IPS
ping ICMP protocol
CIDR: Classless Inter Domain Routing
Notepad: To hang someone's system
@echo off
start mspaint
start cmd
Save in desktop and open
Windows open multiple times and system will hang
If command given in command prompt doesn't work:
Environmental variable->System variable->Path->Edit->Select path->Add->New->Save path->Last/->Enter->Ok
Ping: A tool to test connectivity
Command: ping mkce.ac.in -n 10
Help command: ipconfig --help
Same types of devices: Cross over
Different types of devices: Staight through
For connecting 2 routers: Serial cables or coaxial
Router: Transmits packets from one route to another route
Half duplex: One side packet transmission
Full duplex: Double side packet transmission
NIC: Network Interface Card
MAC: Medium Access Control
