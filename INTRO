AUTHENTICATION VERIFY SOMEONE'S IDENTITY
3 FACTORS:
1)SOMETHING U KNOWN (KNOWLEDGE FACTOR) 
EG:2 FACTOR AUTHENTICATION,EMAIL,SECRET QUESTION,PASSWORD
USERNAME ,PASSWORD SINGLE FACTOR AUTHENTICATION
USERNAME,PASSWORD,OTP 2 FACTOR AUTHENTICATION
2)SOMETHING U HAVE(AADHAR,PAN,VOTER)
3)SOMETIG U ARE(BIOMETRICS,HEIGHT,WEIGHT)
AUTHORIZATION/ACESS CONTROL  PERMISSION TO ACESS
UAC USER ACESS CONTROL (POPUP)
INTEGRITY :ORGINALITY AND GENUINENESS
eg:HTTPS SECURITY MECHANISM
